# Area of Geometric Shapes
A program that will determine the area of a geometric shape.

## Constraints
- Area of a Square
  - a = side
  - A = a<sup>2</sup>
- Area of a Circle
  - r = radius
  - A = pi*r<sup>2</sup>
- Area of an Ellipse
  - a = radius 1
  - b = radius 2
  - A = pi*ab
- Area of a Pentagon
  - a = side
  - A = 1/4(sqrt(5(5+2*sqrt(5))a<sup>2</sup>)

## Requirements
- Use a menu for shape choices.
- Each shape will require one or two inputs.
- Implement if/else statements to act on the user's shape choice outputting both the formula and the results.
- Implement a Switch/Case blok to act on the user's shape choice outputting both the formula and the results.
- Comment out either the if/else or switch case allowing only one set to run per session.
- The formula should output before the results.
- Utilize the Java Math class.

## Notes
- import static java.lang.Math.*;
- System.exit(0);
- System.exit(1);
- Utilize _default_ case in Switch/Case block.
